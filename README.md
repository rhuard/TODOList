# TODOList
C++ todo list manager

I started rhuard/TODOManager when I was in college. I have since learned a lot more about programing.
I still think I would find this program useful, plus I want a real project to practice c++.
So, I am starting this project, it should be basically the same functionality.

Essentially, I want a terminal program that can be used to manage todo lists.
